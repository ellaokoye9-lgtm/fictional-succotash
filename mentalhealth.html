<h2> Mental health</h2>

<p> Mental health is how we feel , think and cope with life.Its not just about being confident and delightful<br>
all the time, but its actually how we deal witht hings like stress, family, school and even making it to the end of the day.
Mental health is just like everyone who has physical health, it can go up and it can go down depending on whats 
going on in our lives.A lot of the times we feel fine, and on the other hand we my feel angry, anxious etc.
This is normal as we are all human.A plethora of individuals, especially youg people , struggle with things like
anxiety, peer pressure, lonliness and low self esteem.It is extremely hard to talk about especially 
when no one around may help you.Multiple people feel the same way even if they dont show it . There 
are places like Mind, Youngmind, Childline and the NHS  that offer a range of support and even advice if needed.
Conquering mental health is about learning to cope, finding ways to feel better and not being afraid to reach and ask for Help
Things like going for a walk, taking solo trips or exercising increase an individualds well being.Mental 
health is a journey , dont be afraid to start.</p>
