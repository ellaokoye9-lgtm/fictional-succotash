<h2>Hello</h2>
<p>My name is Daniella and this website was started in 2025 for my Year 12 Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) in sixth form. To make this website, I had to learn how to code using HTML and CSS, research different ways to support others and resources for mental health support.</p>

<p>A side project I've also been working on has been advocation for Mental health during workshops and projects. I am taking part in the Youth commission police where i go to different places that a low socio economic background and spread awareness. I have also undergone training for paganetry where i had made my passion project about mental health and using that platform given to support those around me.</p>

<p>This website will give you a wide variety of resources to help , ranging from numbers you can call or strategies to improve your mood.</p>
